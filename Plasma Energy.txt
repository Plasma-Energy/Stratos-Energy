Since 1994 a number of scientists, namely: Dr. Francesco Piantelli, Dr. Francesco Celani, 
Dr. Andrea Rossi, Dr. Alexander Parkhomov, Dr. Anatoly Klimov, Dr. Akito Takahashi, 
Dr. Tadahiko Mizuno and other experimented with newly discovered physical phenomena
sometimes called "Low-energy nuclear reactions".

These experiments do not involve radioactive materials. Materials used here are:
Ni, Pd, H, D and other, usually called as "fuel" or "catalyzers".

After more than 20 years of experimenting scientist discovered that it is not
"fuel" which is responsible for excess of energy production. 

Surprisingly, heat energy and a lot of UV light are produced by interactions
between released electrons and virtual particles in evolved plasma.

Produced UV light is so much potent, that it is possible to thermalized it
inside thermal exchanger.

These reactions are aneutronic - not accompanied by release of neutrons
and no harmful ionization is produced.

These plasma energy technologie have fantastic technical parameters,
for example: CoP in excess of 50. One long-time test experienced even CoP=101.

Note: CoP is coefficient of performance. For example heat pumps have usually CoP=4.

These new breakthrough energy technologies are real answer to actual climate change
iniciatives and Green/Environmentalists demands.


A numerous developers teams conducted successful replications of these devices
with independent third parties measured parameters of these devices.

This technology do not need 30 Billion Euros as "eater" ITER (hot-fusion reactor).
Hot-Fusionists got over 240 Billion USD during 65 years and never produced
even 1 kWh of excess energy.

With proper support it is possible to have own unique plasma energy technology
with different design and different output. Technically these are not extremely
complicated and are cost effective.
